        The handle() method should return true if the event has been dealt with
        and we do not wish it to be handled by any other handler we may also have
        defined. Whether you return true or false depends on the behaviour you
        want - here we have no other handlers defined so return true. **/

                Mouse events have associated event names, and mouse
                position co-ordinates. **/

                    Once we have received the mouse event, we can
                    perform some action. Here we perform mouse picking.
 
                    Mouse picking can be thought of as shooting a "ray"
                    from the mouse position into our scene, and determining
                    which parts of the scene intersect with the ray.
                    Typically we will only be interested in the firstfalse
                    (if any) object that the ray hits. We can then perform
                    some action.
 
                    In this example, we are going to interact with our
                    car model - if the mouse has "picked" it, we will
                    start a simple rotation on it. **/

                    different ways, however, the OSG documentation recommends
                    using the following steps: **/

                /** 2. Create an IntersectionVisitor, passing the
                    Intersector as parameter to the constructor. **/
                osgUtil::IntersectionVisitor iV(lI);
 
                /** 3. Launch the IntersectionVisitor on the root node of
                    the scene graph. In an OSGART application, we can
                    launch it on the osgART::Scene node. **/
