About osgART.
-------------
osgART is a library that simplifies the development of Augmented Reality or Mixed Reality applications by combining the well-known ARToolKit tracking library with OpenSceneGraph. But rather than acting just as a simple nodekit, the library offers 3 main functionalities: high level integration of video input (video object, shaders), spatial registration (marker-based, multiple trackers), and photometric registration (occlusion, shadow).

With osgART, users gain the benefit of all the features of OpenSceneGraph (high quality renderer, multiple file type loaders, community nodekits like osgAL, etc.) directly in their augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) or mediated reality applications.
As with the standard ARToolKit, the user can thus develop and prototype interactive applications that can use tangible interaction (in C++, Python, Lua, Ruby etc.).

The latest version of osgART is always available from ARToolworks at http://www.artoolworks.com/osgart/.

osgART is supported on the Linux, Windows, and Macintosh OS X platforms.


The osgART license model.
----------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHT TO USE OSGART:

osgART is published in two editions; osgART Standard and osgART Professional.

Like ARToolKit, osgART is freely available for non-commercial use under the terms of the GNU General Public License. A proprietary version of osgART developed in parallel for professional commercial use by ARToolworks, Inc. is made available under different license terms, to suit end-user need.

We believe this model offers the best of both worlds. Persons developing their software under an open source model are freely availed of the osgART Standard Edition source code, and the osgART open source project benefits in return from enhancements, bug reports, and external development ideas. Those persons developing under a proprietary source model, from whom the osgART code base does not benefit through reciprocal openness, contribute financially instead. License fees fund research and development of today's and tomorrow's versions of the osgART through research activities at partner institutions.


The GPL-licensed osgART Standard Edition.:

osgART Standard Edition is a basic version of osgART and is freely licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL license. It includes an ARToolKit plugin and numerous examples which will guide you through from a simple video viewer to a animated, interactive AR application.

osgART Standard Edition comes without support, but an active community of osgART users has already developed and joining this community is recommended for all osgART users. The osgART community website: http://www.artoolworks.com/community/osgart/

osgART Standard Edition version 1.0 is GPL-licensed. Please read the full text of the GPL prior to downloading and/or using the osgART Standard Edition source code. Your downloading and/or use of the code signifies acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license. If you are unable to comply with the license terms, please immediately destroy all copies of the code in your possession.

Please be aware that while the GPL allows you to freely use the source code, it also imposes certain restrictions on the ways in which you can use the code. Your attention is drawn particularly to section 2b of the GPL: "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.", i.e. your software incorporating or linking to osgART Standard Edition must also be open-source software, licensed under the GPL. Use of the osgART Standard Edition in breach of the terms of the GPL will be subject to legal action by the copyright holders.


The commercially-licensed osgART Professional Edition:

osgART Professional Edition is an advanced version of osgART with plugins for a variety of different tracking architectures including ARToolKit Professional and ARToolKit NFT, advanced video input plugins and support for a wide variety of high-end video sources, extended examples including advanced rendering techniques, and much more.

Licenses for osgART Professional Edition are fee-bearing, but allow access to the advanced features and inclusion of osgART in propriety products.

Priority tecnical support, access to the osgART developers, and hot code fixes are available from ARToolworks, Inc.

osgART Professional Edition is the right product for professional and commercial use by persons for whom the GPL license terms are not ideal. License arrangements are managed by ARToolworks, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA. A variety of license types are available at reasonable cost. Please contact ARToolworks, Inc. directly for information on products, license terms, and pricing.

ARToolworks also provide a variety of value-added services, including professional support, customization and other modifications, and end-user turnkey applications.


Building on Windows.
--------------------
The latest version of these instructions can be found at http://www.artoolworks.com/community/osgart/docs_install.html#build_windows

You will find project files for Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005 in the /VisualStudio/osgART/ folder in the source package. We are not yet actively supporting Visual Studio 2005 due to OSG and some required SDKs lack of support.

* Make sure Visual Studio .NET 2003 can find headers and libraries for OpenSceneGraph and ARToolKit
* Build the libraries in the following order:
	osgART
	osgart_artoolkit
	osgart_artoolkit_tracker
	osgart_dummyimage
	osgart_example

* For debugging purposes we also recommend to keep the OpenSceneGraph/bin directory in the $PATH variable.


Building on Linux / SGI Irix.
-----------------------------
The latest version of these instructions can be found at http://www.artoolworks.com/community/osgart/docs_install.html#build_linux

1) Requirements:


1.1) Hardware
- video capture device (webcam, DV cam, video files, etc. pp.) accessible 
  for ARToolKit (please consult ARToolKit documentation)
- OpenGL hardware accelerated graphics hardware

1.2) Software

- gcc 3.x or higher
- GNU make
- binutils
- X11 development libraries (for X.org 7.x make sure to install Xm and Xi 
  development libraries)
- OpenSceneGraph 1.x development libraries (recommended version 1.1 or 1.2) 
- depending on the video capture library you choose you need development
  libraries for:
	- GStreamer - gstreamer 0.10.x (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org)
	- Video4Linux - linux kernel headers (consult your distribution docs)
	- lib1394 and libraw1394

2) Compiling ARToolKit:

- ARToolKit 2.72 (download from http://projects.sourceforge.net/artoolkit)

- compile ARToolKit (read the documentation for video capture in ARToolKit)

- make sure that /home/thatsme/Projects/artoolkit/bin/videoTest works


3) Compiling osgART

- unpack osgART 

	$> tar xfzj osgART-x.x.tar.bz2

- if you unpacked osgART into /home/thatsme/Projects/osgART

	$> cd /home/thatsme/Projects/osgART/bin

- you need to know where artoolkit is installed and start make

	$> make -f GNUmakefile ARTOOLKIT_PATH="/home/thatsme/Projects/artoolkit"

- assure the ARTOOLKIT_CONFIG is set correctly for the videocapture you 
  are using. For example using GStreamer with the TV testsignal simulator 
  you can use:

	$> echo $ARTOOLKIT_CONFIG
	videotestsrc ! identity name=artoolkit ! fakesink

	or for using Video4Linux it should read something like this:

	$> echo $ARTOOLKIT_CONFIG
	-dev=/dev/video0 -width=320 -height=240 -palette=YUV420P

  Please consult the ARToolKit documentation for more information how to set 
  up video capturing correctly.

- to run the example the runtime linker need to be able to load the plugins. 
  For example in a bash shell:

	$> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

- run the example 
	
	$> ./osgart_example
	

4) Advanced

For using the same build system as osgART you need bakefile 
(http://bakefile.sourceforge.net). You can copy the original bakefile to a
new one and add another target for your application.

	$> cd /home/thatsme/Projects/osgART/bin
	$> cp osgART.bkl MyosgART.bkl
	
You need to edit the bakefile for making changes to the source and include
directories of your project. Additionally you need to regenerate the
makefile from the bakefile.

	$> bakefile -f gnu MyosgART.bkl
	

Building on Mac OS X.
---------------------------
The latest version of these instructions can be found at http://www.artoolworks.com/community/osgart/docs_install.html#build_mac

Prerequisites:
 *  Apple's Xcode Tools, version 2.4 or later. Available free with registration with ADC at http://developer.apple.com.
 *  ARToolKit version 2.72 or later. ARToolKit may have additional dependencies listed in its readme file.
 *  OpenSceneGraph 1.1 or later in Mac OS X binary format. (version 1.2 recommended.)

Setting up the necessary directory structure:
osgART must be able to find its dependencies during the build process. The XCode project file comes setup for a folder structure like this:
someDirectory/   (top-level development directory)
	ARToolKit/
		bin
		examples
		include
		lib
	OpenSceneGraph/
		Examples/
		Frameworks/
		Plugins/
	OSGART/
		bin/
		docs/
		etc/
		include/
		src/
		VisualStudio/
		XCode/
If you wish to change this structure, you must edit the search path settings inside the build settings inspector for every one of the targets.

Building using the XCode IDE:
(1) Unpack the archive to a convenient location, and open the file XCode/osgART.xcodeproj.
(2) Make sure that ARToolKit 2.72 builds and that you can run the simpleLite ARToolKit example without errors.
(2) Build osgART.


Running the built application:
The osgARTTest example is built as a bundled application, and can be moved from its original location to anywhere on the system. It can be run double clicked from the Finder (debug output will appear in Console) or from within XCode.


Changes in version 1.0 (this release) (2006-12-18).
------------------------------------------------------
All platforms:
- The structure of osgART has been significantly reorganised during the beta release process. If you were participating in the beta test program, we recommend that you carefully examine the examples for correct usage patterns.
- A large number of examples have been added to the project. Enjoy!
- osgART now has a plugin structure for video sources and tracking libraries. osgART Standard Edition comes with default plugins for ARToolKit 2.72's libARVideo video library and libAR tracker library.


Known issues in this release.
-----------------------------
- VideoBillboard is still broken. Sorry.
- Due to an issue in OpenSceneGraph, YCbCr-format video streams are not yet supported. On Mac OS X, make sure that ARToolKit's default video format is ARGB.
- The Mac osgARTTest opens in multiple windows on a multi-display system.
- The Mac XCode project file includes targets for only the osgARTTest example. The other exmples will be added later.


Changes in earlier releases.
